A white ferry with red and blue accents, named 'COLUMBIA', cruises on a calm river, its two-tiered structure featuring large windows and a German flag, against a backdrop of modern and traditional buildings. As it moves, the ferry, now identified with 'COLUMBIA' and 'Rhein Express' text, continues its journey under an overcast sky, with a stone wall and a mix of modern and historical architecture in the background. The scene shifts to show the ferry with 'COLUMBUS' and 'Rhein Express' text, cruising on a river that reflects the sky, with a stone wall and a mix of modern and traditional buildings, including a Gothic church, under a clear sky.
