Four professionals, two men and two women, are engaged in a collaborative meeting in an office. Initially, a man in a navy blazer and a woman in a brown checkered blazer are seen discussing a laptop screen, with another man in a white sweater and a woman in a black and white patterned coat observing. As time progresses, the group's dynamic shifts slightly; the man in the navy blazer now points at the laptop screen, indicating a discussion or presentation, while the woman in the brown blazer smiles and engages with the content. The man in the white sweater gestures thoughtfully, and the woman in the black and white patterned coat appears contemplative, hand to cheek.
