Three young women, dressed in cozy winter attire, stand together in a tranquil outdoor setting, engaging in the warmth of sharing a hot drink. Initially, they are seen in a moment of camaraderie, with one woman sipping from a mug, another pouring from a thermos, and the third observing. As moments pass, their activities slightly change; one woman sips from a white mug, another examines a small metal cup, and the third holds a stainless steel thermos. Their expressions of contentment and enjoyment, along with the soft natural lighting, highlight the serene atmosphere of their gathering.
