A colossal Buddha statue in meditation sits atop a white base with classical columns, surrounded by a dense forest. The statue's pinkish-brown robe contrasts with the greenery and the partly cloudy sky. A dirt path leads to the base, suggesting human presence. As the view continues, the Buddha statue, still in its meditative pose, is seen atop a white building with a red-tiled roof, set against a backdrop of lush greenery and a partly cloudy sky. The scene is serene, with the Buddha's hands gently resting in the lap, and the surrounding forest and sky enhancing the tranquil atmosphere.
