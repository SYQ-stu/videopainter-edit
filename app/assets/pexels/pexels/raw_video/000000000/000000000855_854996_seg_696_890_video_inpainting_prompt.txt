A solitary figure stands on a pebble-strewn beach at sunset, silhouetted against the setting sun. The calm sea reflects the golden light, with distant islets visible. The sky transitions from orange to blue, creating a serene atmosphere. The scene is marked by a sense of solitude and contemplation. Two seconds later, the figure remains on the beach, now with a black backpack and a white surfboard nearby, suggesting a recent or intended surf session. The tranquil sea and the sky's warm glow continue to enhance the peaceful mood.
